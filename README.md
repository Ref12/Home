# ReF12
Landing repo for discussions, issues, and wiki for https://ref12.io.

ref12.io is a replacement/successor to https://referencesource.microsoft.com, http://sourceroslyn.io, https://source.dot.net, and other sites generated by [SourceBrowser](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/SourceBrowser). Though, they serve a similar function Ref12's architecture and backend are completely different. The initial implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/Ref12/Codex).

To browse source, simply open https://ref12.io in your browser. By default, you can navigate the dotnet/runtime and other assorted repos currently found in https://source.dot.net. A much larger set of repos is available to sponsors. See list here. TODO: Allow querying list of repos from ref12.io.

## Conceptual design

Indexing happens in two phases: Analysis and Ingestion. During analysis, C#/VB source files are analyzed using Roslyn and files are generated containing the extracted semantic information. These files are typically packaged into a zip file and ingested elsewhere. During ingestion, the analysis files are loaded an their information is added to a custom database. The database is used to satisfy all queries. The database format allows it to be queried in a serverless manner using WASM but this is untenable for larger codebases or aggregations of codebases.

Indexing *is* incremental. Many repos can be analyzed and ingested at different times.

### Limitations and known issues
 * Analysis requires a successful build of projects or successful extraction of compilation using Roslyn MSBuildWorkspace.

### Features
* Semantic analysis of C#, VB, and MSBuild
* Syntax Scoloring for C#, VB, MSBuild, XML
* Scope to a repo using format https://ref12.io/{owner}/{repository} (i.e https://ref12.io/dotnet/wpf)
* Go To Definition (click on a reference)
* Find All Reference (click on a definition)
* Project Explorer - in any document click on the Project link at the bottom
* Document Outline - for a document click on the button in top right to display types and members in the current file
* Clicking on the partial keyword will display a list of all files where this type is declared
* MSBuild files (.csproj etc) have hyperlinks
