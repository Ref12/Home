# ReF12
Landing repo for discussions, issues, and wiki for https://ref12.io.

ref12.io is a replacement/successor to https://referencesource.microsoft.com, http://sourceroslyn.io, https://source.dot.net, and other sites generated by [SourceBrowser](https://github.com/KirillOsenkov/SourceBrowser). Though, they serve a similar function Ref12's architecture and backend are completely different. The initial implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/Ref12/Codex). Ref12 does an initial pass to build and analyze the target repository and emit files containing the semantic information found in each file. Secondly, the analysis files are ingested into a custom database which is queried to answer queries for website. This approach enables aggregating an arbitrary number of repositories. Further, repositories can be added/removed at any time without needed to re-analyzed or ingest other repos.

To browse source, simply open https://ref12.io in your browser. By default, you can navigate the dotnet/runtime and other assorted repos currently found in https://source.dot.net. A much larger set of repos is available to sponsors. See list here. TODO: Allow querying list of repos from ref12.io.
